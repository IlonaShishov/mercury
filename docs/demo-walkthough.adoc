= eWallet Activation Demo Walkthrough

:numbered:

== Demo Overview

=== Pre-conditions

The customer goes through the necessary basic identification, authentication, and authorization checks. They are already flagged as a disaster victim and this detail is used in the contact routing decision. An assisted servicing session is initiated and the contact routed to a CSR trained in disaster relief. The Customer Service Representative (CSR) gets the details of their active case as background. 

The customer explains the problem – they are trying to buy a replacement phone in the shop and mistakenly thought they could pay using the on-line banking application, but they need their card details and they have all been lost (she is getting replacements). The CSR suggests setting up an E-Wallet that will download all the card details – including the new one specifically set up for thaeir disaster account. 

The customer agrees and they start the e-wallet application process. In order to issue the card details, a higher level of authentication is needed and the CSR guides the customer through answering additional security questions to raise the contact authentication level as needed.

=== Scenario Description

The CSR initiates the product deployment process that exports the secure card details to the phone. Since the customer expressed interest in the Builder App as suggested (in previous conversation), the CSR also gets the details from the product directory and initiates the process to register the customer for the service.

== Demo Architecture

The following section talks about how the above Demo Scenario is represented using the BIAN specification. To better understand this, let us quickly take a look at some of the key terms related to the BIAN specification.

=== BIAN API Reference

**Business Scenario**: A BIAN Business Scenario models the handling of a single business event rather than a conventional business process. A business scenario is an archetypal illustration of a possible set of service interactions that might occur between a collection of Service Domains as they handle the event.

**Service Domain**: A Service Domain represents the combination of one pattern of commercialization behavior being applied to instances of one type of asset and the Service Domain is defined to be responsible for fulfilling this business function for the complete lifecycle and for as many times as might be necessary.

**Functional Pattern**: The functional pattern provides a clear indication of the core functionality provided by the Service Domain.

**Action Term**: Action Term characterizes the type of service operation exchanges that a Service Domain supports.

**Control Record**: Every BIAN Service Domain specification defines a single associated operational artifact called its Control record. This is simply the mechanism it uses to control or trace the execution of one occurrence of it performing its business role for a complete lifecycle.

The diagram below shows the BIAN Business Scenarios diagram of the Demo Use Case.

.BIAN Business Scenario
image::image5.png[Business Scenario 3]

The first step in the workflow is to check the customer’s eligibility with the call to Customer Product/Service Eligibility(Service Domain). This call causes the service domain to evaluate whether the customer is eligible for the proposed product/service and return any specific eligibility terms.

. Customer Service Representative(CSR) initiates a customer offer session to identify the processing requirements and set up the selected product (E-Wallet).

. Customer Offer (Service Domain) calls Product Directory to get the offering terms/requirements for processing an application to get the E-Wallet.

. Customer Offer(Service Domain) calls Product Deployment(Service Domain) to initiate the download to the customer device.

. Customer Offer(Service Domain) calls Customer Product/Service Eligibility(Service Domain) to update the status with the newly applied product.

. Customer Offer (Service Domain) calls Product Directory to get the offering terms/requirements for processing an application to get the Builder Application.

. Customer Offer(Service Domain) calls Customer Product/Service Eligibility(Service Domain) to update the status with the newly applied product.

The table below shows how the Business Scenario maps against the BIAN API specification.

=== Logical Model

Let us now look at how the logical design for the implementation of the above use case.

.Demo architecture logical view
image::image2.png[Demo Architecture Logical View]

The Customer Service Representative selects “New Product Application Processing” from the Servicing Order Menu. As we saw earlier, the first step is to get the Customer’s eligibility for the product (e-Wallet). The Servicing Order UI invokes an external API as governed by the API gateway. This invokes the call to Evaluate Eligibility. The Service Domain invokes the corresponding rules for the eligibility criteria and returns back the results to the caller.

Next, the call to set up the product (e-Wallet/Builder Application) is initiated via the External APIs. This then invokes a call to Initiate Offer. The Service Domain makes three other calls to other Service Domains. First, it calls the Product Directory to get the processing requirements (Product Terms). Next, it invokes the Product Deployment to set up the product on the Customer’s phone. Lastly, it calls the Customer Product Service Eligibility, to update the Product Usage. Finally, this calls returns with either a success/failure on the Initiate operation.


=== Technical Architecture


Now let us look at the Tech Stack for the implementation. Each of the involved Service Domains is implemented as a microservice on Red Hat Openshift.


**Red Hat OpenShift**:  Enables efficient container orchestration, allowing rapid container provisioning, deploying, scaling, and management. Red Hat Integration on OpenShift helps us rapidly create and manage the web-scale cloud-native applications.

.Demo architecture with technology stack
image::image7.png[Demo Architecture Tech Stack]

**Quarkus**: Showcases a sample UI application for Servicing Order. The application is developed using Quarkus. Quarkus provides an effective solution for running Java in this new world of serverless, microservices, containers, Kubernetes, FaaS, and the cloud because it has been designed with these technologies in mind[b].

**Red Hat 3Scale API Management**: Provides for an external API for the UI applications to interact with. RedHat 3-scale API Management provides for an API infrastructure that makes it easy to manage your APIs. It allows users to share, secure, distribute, control, and monetize APIs on an infrastructure platform built for performance, customer control, and future growth.

**Red Hat Fuse**: Provides a lightweight, cloud-native, scalable way of developing and deploying the Service Domains. Red Hat Fuse with its API-centric, container-based architecture decouples services so they can be created, extended, and deployed independently.

**Red Hat Decision Manager**: Provides for a Business User-Friendly authoring experience for defining the rules governing the Eligibility Criteria. Red Hat Decision Manager is a platform for developing containerized microservices and applications that automate business decisions. Red Hat Decision Manager provides for the ability to execute DMN (Decision Model Notation) artifacts. This enables the Business experts to independently create and manage the assets without dependencies on IT.

**OpenShift Service Mesh**: Provides for a way to control how different parts of an application share data with one another. This visible infrastructure layer can document how well (or not) different parts of an app interact, so it becomes easier to optimize communication and avoid downtime as an app grows.

== Implementation Walkthrough

This section describes some key implementation details of the POC.

=== Creating a Service Domain Implementation

The BIAN API portal provides API definition in the form of swagger. This can be used to generate the API methods for each of the service domains. Let us now look at an example of how we can quickly create a Service Domain and deploy it on Openshift.


. Download the Swagger File for the Service Domain from the BIAN Portal.

. Create a Red Hat Fuse starter project (Spring Boot) using the following archetype.
+
[source,shell]
-----
mvn org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-archetype-plugin:2.4:generate \
    -DarchetypeCatalog=https://maven.repository.redhat.com/ga/io/fabric8/archetypes/archetypes-catalog/2.2.0.fuse-730042-redhat-00002/archetypes-catalog-2.2.0.fuse-730042-redhat-00002-archetype-catalog.xml \
    -DarchetypeGroupId=org.jboss.fuse.fis.archetypes \
    -DarchetypeArtifactId=spring-boot-camel-xml-archetype \
    -DarchetypeVersion=2.2.0.fuse-730042-redhat-00002
-----

. Include the plugin for generating the camel routes from the swagger json.
+
Red Hat Fuse has two main ways of defining routing rules: Java DSL and XML. We will be focusing on the Java-based DSL.
+
The plugin reads the swagger json from a directory and generates a camel route java file in the directory as mentioned in the plugin configuration.
+
[source,xml]
-----
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.camel</groupId>
    <artifactId>camel-restdsl-swagger-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.21.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <specificationUri>${project.basedir}/src/spec/product-deployment.json</specificationUri>
        <className>CamelRoutes</className>
        <packageName>com.redhat.productdeployment</packageName>
        <outputDirectory>${project.basedir}/src/main/java/com/redhat/productdeployment</outputDirectory>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
-----

. Configuring the __Camel REST DSL__.
link:https://camel.apache.org[Apache Camel^] provides a starter module that allows you to develop SpringBoot applications using starters. We will annotate the generated camel route with `@Component` and add the __REST DSL__ configuration as below.
+
[source,java]
-----
@Component
@Generated("org.apache.camel.generator.swagger.PathGenerator")
public final class CamelRoutes extends RouteBuilder {
   /**
    * Defines Apache Camel routes using REST DSL fluent API.
    */
   @Bean
   public ServletRegistrationBean servletRegistrationBean() {
       ServletRegistrationBean registration = new ServletRegistrationBean(new CamelHttpTransportServlet(), "/service/*");
       registration.setName("CamelServlet");
       return registration;
   }

   public void configure() {

       restConfiguration()
               .component("servlet")
               .bindingMode(RestBindingMode.auto)
               .producerComponent("http4")
               .apiContextPath("/swagger")
               .apiContextRouteId("swagger")
               .contextPath("/service")
               .host("localhost:8080")
               .apiProperty("api.title", "Example REST api")
               .apiProperty("api.version", "1.0");

       rest()
           .post("/product-directory/activation")
               .id("activateSDProductDirectory")
               .description("Activate  a  SDProductDirectory servicing session")
               .produces("application/json")
               .param()
                   .name("body")
                   .type(RestParamType.body)
                   .required(true)
                   .description("SDProductDirectory Request Payload")
               .endParam()
-----

. Set the swagger path.
+
With the __REST DSL__ configuration, we have already enabled swagger support, let us now set the swagger-ui path with the following configuration.
+
[source,java]
-----
@Configuration
    public class MyConfiguratrion {
        // Redirect to access swagger UI via short URL from "/swagger-ui" to "/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/api/swagger&validatorUrl="
        @Controller
        class SwaggerWelcome {
            @RequestMapping("/swagger-ui")
            public String redirectToUi() {
                return "redirect:/webjars/swagger-ui/index.html?url=/service/swagger&validatorUrl=";
            }
        }
    }
-----

. Implement a sample route.
+
Let us now as an example create the implementation for one of the routes as below.
+
[source,java]
-----
rest()
    .post("/product-directory/activation")
        .id("activateSDProductDirectory")
        .description("Activate  a  SDProductDirectory servicing session")
        .produces("application/json")
        .param()
            .name("body")
            .type(RestParamType.body)
            .required(true)
            .description("SDProductDirectory Request Payload")
        .endParam()
        .to("direct:activateSDProductDirectory");

    from("direct:activateSDProductDirectory")
        .log("${body}");
-----

. Execute the spring boot application.
+
We will execute the spring boot application, use the following maven goal.
+
[source,shell]
-----
mvn clean install
java -jar target/product-directory-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
-----
+
The swagger ui should now be accessible at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui
+
For deploying on Openshift
+
[source,shell]
-----
oc new-app java:8~https:<git_path>
-----
+
The Service Domains for the POC can be found link:https://github.com/rh-mercury/mercury-sd-camel[here^].


=== Data Models for Inter Domain Communication

Since the Service Domains invoke other domains, there is a need to have the data models available centrally, so that the service domains can communicate in the vocabulary established by these domains. The data model library for the POC can be found link:https://github.com/rh-mercury/mercury-sd-camel/tree/master/bianservicedomainmodels[here^].


=== Eligibility Evaluation using Business Rules

In the Business Scenario, which we are implementing as part of the POC, one of the first and most important steps is to determine the eligibility of a customer for a product. This Eligibility can be modeled using Business Rules and externalized so that it can be created and managed by the Business User. The following section talks about how we include a rule artifact and execute it as a part of the Service Domain.

Eligibility involves a combination of Status, Demographics, and Product related checks. A typical Eligibility Criteria may be represented as below. The representation here has been expressed in standard notation for defining Decision artifacts called DMN(Decision Model Notation). Refer to the following link to understand more about the authoring capabilities of Red Hat Decision Manager which allows us to create a rule artifact.  The Eligibility decision for the POC can be found here. The rule artifact is built as a jar file, we will pull this jar file in our Service Domain and execute the rule in an embedded manner.

       DMNModel dmnModel = dmnRuntime.getModel(namespace, modelName);
       DMNContext dmnContext = dmnRuntime.newContext();

       //Customer Data Lookup, Mock data setup for test
       dmnContext.set("KYC Check",true);
       dmnContext.set("Member Since",2018);

       DMNDecisionResult resultOffer =  dmnResult.getDecisionResultByName("Product Eligibility");
       boolean resultOfferPayload = (boolean)resultOffer.getResult();
-----

=== Monitoring the Fuse routes

The Fuse Console is a web-based console that you access from a browser to monitor and manage a running Fuse container. The Fuse Console is based on Hawtio open source software (http://hawt.io/).

To enable the Fuse console, add the following configuration.

. Add the Hawtio maven dependencies
+
[source,java]
-----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.hawt</groupId>
    <artifactId>hawtio-springboot</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0.fuse-000201-redhat-3</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>io.hawt</groupId>
    <artifactId>hawtio-core</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0.fuse-000201-redhat-3</version>
</dependency>
-----

. Add the following configuration to the `application.properties`.
+
[source,properties]
-----
endpoints.hawtio.sensitive = false
endpoints.hawtio.enabled = true
endpoints.jolokia.enabled = true
hawtio.authenticationEnabled=false
management.port = 10001
-----

The Hawtio management console can be reached at http://localhost:10001/hawtio.

If using Openshift create a route that exposes the `10001` port to get to the hawtio console.


== Demo Walkthrough

Let us now look at the demo walkthrough. As described in the Scenario abstract above, the customer calls the CSR and discusses the disaster issue she is experiencing. The CSR brings up the New Product Application Processing page on the Servicing Order UI.

.Servicing Order web application user interface
image::image4.png[Servicing Order Web UI]

As you can see the Customer has been qualified as a good prospect for the ‘Disaster Campaign’ class . The CSR now chooses the product type (e-Wallet) and Checks for Eligibility. The eligibility results show that the following checks have been completed for the customer and the eligibility came back  as shown below.

.Eligibility Check operation in the Servicing Order application
image::image9.png[Eligibility Check operation]

The Eligibility check here is a complex decisioning logic which uses historical, profile and predictive data from the customer to determine the eligibility. The following representation shows the Decision Logic as expressed in the standard link:https://www.omg.org/dmn/[Decision Model Notation (DMN)^] format.

.Eligibility Check decision model
image::image3.png[Eligibility Check decision model]

Since the eligibility criteria came back true, the CSR now chooses a disclosure for the product and proceeds with adding it to the Customer’s profile.

.Add Product to customer profile
image::image8.png[Add Product operation]

Now initiates a call which retrieves the Product terms, initiates the download of the product on the customer’s device and updates the Product Usage Status for the customer.

.Add Product result
image::image1.png[Add Product result]

The following view shows a monitoring insight into what happened with this call.

.Fuse Console route details
image::image6.png[Fuse Route]

The visual representation shows a graphical understanding of the path that this specific call took. Among other things, the tooling also supports real time debugging into the routes and metrics on the number of times a route was invoked.
